## Description

This project is a simple p5.js sketch created to confirm that my development setup and GitHub Pages deployment work correctly. The sketch displays a splash screen with a short message inspired by the idea of “building a journey,” and transitions to a second screen once the user clicks.

---

## Interaction Instructions

When the sketch loads, a splash screen appears.
Click anywhere on the screen to move forward.
